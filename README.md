# Book Manager

The Book Manager is used to manage, track and note your reading progress during your academic endeavours. I created this program for 
2 reasons:
- To track my reading progress, because I prefer to read to learn programming concepts. 
- To practice my JavaScript and VueJS abilities. 

This application was written using Vue 2.0 rather than Vue 3.0. This is 
because I wanted to use a component library called Vuesax, however this does not support Vue 3.0 yet. The conversion to Vue 3.0
is not a huge effort, so when Vuesax for Vue 3.0 is available, I shall convert the code over to Vue 3.0. 

The instructions for the application are on the Home page of the application.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run electron:serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run electron:build
```

Once built, go to dist_electron, and run the "Book Manager Setup 0.1.0" installer.
