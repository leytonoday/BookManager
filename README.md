# Book Manager

The Book Manager is used to manage, track and note your reading progress during your academic endeavours. I created this program for 
2 reasons:
- To track my reading progress, because I prefer to read to learn programming concepts. 
- To practice my JavaScript and VueJS abilities. 

This application was written using Vue 2.0 rather than Vue 3.0. This is 
because I wanted to use a component library called Vuesax, however this does not support Vue 3.0 yet. The conversion to Vue 3.0
is not a huge effort, so when Vuesax for Vue 3.0 is available, I shall convert the code over to Vue 3.0. 

The instructions for the application are on the Home page of the application.

## Features
Features include:
- Automatic addition of book data, just search the book name and pick from the search results, and click to see a preview! See figure 1
- Beautiful pinterest-esque stacking book cards in the Card View. See figure 2
- Efficient Tabular View for managing and editing several books at once. See figure 3
- Bookmarking and note taking, with a rich text editor! See figure 4
- Statistics to analyse your reading habits and your libraries growth. See figure 5
- Fully customizable accent colour, and a crisp light mode available. See figure 6 and 7
- Finally, for those obscure books that aren't documented by the Google Books API, you can manually input their details
